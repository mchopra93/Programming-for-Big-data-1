Wonderful dinner with great friends.i love this place,i want to visit this place again and again,so delicious at #Tutti Santi Ristorante
Meatballs, Roast Beef, Provolone, Sauce and pepperoncini !!! Yummmmm.  eating sandwich at  #Jersey Mike's Subs
BBQ burgers and Fries like we had during our hanabata days!! Yummy The service here isn't better or worse than other quick serve places in the area.  They serve a purpose but aren't doing anything over an above.#QBBQandBurger  #Waterloo #YouGottaEatHere #TripleMeatPlatter #YUM #KWAwesome #KWFood
Dim sum time!,i hate the service and ambiance The food is fairly consistent for Swiss Chalet but the service is very obviously lacking. It is immediately and constantly apparent that the staff couldn't care less  #HongKongCafe
It's gotten to the point where Jason's Deli remembered my order right when I walked in ahahahha I hate myself  #JasonDeli
To yummy,I've had poke a few times since it popped up; and it's great here.  I do not doubt there are line ups daily!  If you get a chance to try it, it's definitely worth it!  I really like their calamari platter. Great portions and service! my mouth is watering just writing this review!#happywok #teriyaki
Everyone is either downtown or heading there and I'm in Concord Ohio eating waffles at waffle house. #WaffleHouse
